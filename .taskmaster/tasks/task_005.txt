# Task ID: 5
# Title: Design and Implement Three Distinct Biomes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the three main game environments (Singing Meadowlands, Whispering Canopy, Floating Garden Archipelago) with unique visual styles, gameplay characteristics, and environmental storytelling.
# Details:
1. Design and implement Singing Meadowlands (tutorial area):
   - Open meadow environment with gentle terrain
   - Tutorial integration points
   - Basic enemy encounters
   - Initial lore fragments

2. Design and implement Whispering Canopy (mid-game):
   - Vertical forest environment with platforming elements
   - Mid-game puzzle focus
   - Intermediate enemy encounters
   - Hidden paths and secrets

3. Design and implement Floating Garden Archipelago (late-game):
   - Disconnected floating islands requiring advanced traversal
   - Late-game challenges and puzzles
   - Advanced enemy encounters
   - Major lore revelations

4. Implement Veil Sight ability revealing hidden paths and spirit trails
5. Create environmental storytelling through discoverable lore fragments
6. Develop dynamic waypoint system for optional guidance

Implementation approach:
- Use Unity Terrain system with custom shaders for each biome
- Implement procedural foliage placement with wind animation
- Create custom post-processing profiles for each biome's atmosphere
- Develop transition zones between biomes for seamless world

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance testing in each biome for target frame rates
2. Verify loading times under 5 seconds between areas
3. Test Veil Sight ability functionality across all biomes
4. Validate environmental storytelling elements and lore fragments
5. Playtest navigation and exploration flow
6. Verify secrets are accessible through different progression stages
7. Test dynamic waypoint system functionality
