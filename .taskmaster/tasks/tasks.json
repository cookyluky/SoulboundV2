Create new UI Canvas specifically for OneUI inventory system\n2. Configure Canvas Scaler for responsive design (1920×1080 base with 30% scale support per PRD)\n3. Set up OneUI component integration\n4. Create basic inventory container structure\n5. Prepare for pod-based organization system\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Create \"OneUI_InventoryCanvas\" in scene\n- Configure canvas settings for organic inventory theme\n- Import necessary OneUI components for inventory UI\n</info added on 2025-07-02T01:54:49.688Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-02T01:56:36.235Z>\n## ✅ OneUI Kit Integration Implementation Complete\n\n**Files Created:**\n- ✅ `Assets/Scripts/UI/OneUI_InventoryManager.cs` - Main inventory management script\n- ✅ `Documentation/Objects/UI/OneUI_InventoryCanvas.md` - Object documentation\n\n**Key Implementation Features:**\n- **Canvas Configuration**: Responsive design with 1920×1080 base and 30% scale support per PRD\n- **OneUI Integration**: Uses DevsDaddy.Shared.UIFramework namespace\n- **Manager Integration**: Connects with existing @EssenceManager and @InputManager\n- **Accessibility Foundation**: Prepared for high-contrast mode, keyboard navigation, screen reader support\n- **Pod System Structure**: Foundation ready for 4-pod organization system\n\n**Unity Editor Steps for Canvas Setup:**\n\n## Unity Editor Instructions for OneUI_InventoryCanvas\n\n**Step 1: Create OneUI Inventory Canvas**\n1. Right-click in Hierarchy → UI → Canvas → Name: \"OneUI_InventoryCanvas\"\n2. Select OneUI_InventoryCanvas → Inspector:\n   - Render Mode: Screen Space - Overlay  \n   - Sorting Order: 100\n   - Target Display: Display 1\n\n**Step 2: Configure Canvas Scaler (Auto-created)**\n1. Select OneUI_InventoryCanvas → Canvas Scaler component:\n   - UI Scale Mode: Scale With Screen Size\n   - Reference Resolution: X=1920, Y=1080\n   - Screen Match Mode: Match Width Or Height  \n   - Match: 0.5\n   - Reference Pixels Per Unit: 100\n\n**Step 3: Add OneUI_InventoryManager Script**\n1. Select OneUI_InventoryCanvas → Add Component → Scripts → OneUI_InventoryManager\n2. Configure OneUI_InventoryManager properties:\n   - Inventory Canvas: Drag OneUI_InventoryCanvas (self-reference)\n   - Canvas Scaler: Drag Canvas Scaler component (auto-references)\n   - Hotkey Slot Count: 4\n   - Enable Debug Logging: ✓ (checked)\n   - Enable Keyboard Navigation: ✓ (checked)\n   - Enable Screen Reader Support: ✓ (checked)\n\n**Step 4: Verify EventSystem (Required for UI)**\n1.
