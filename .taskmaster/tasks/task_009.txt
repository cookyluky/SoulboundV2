# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Narrative and Choice System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the five-act narrative structure with branching dialogue choices, multiple endings based on corruption level and key decisions, and the Elysia trust system.
# Details:
1. Create DialogueManager for conversation handling
2. Implement choice system with corruption and trust consequences
3. Develop StoryManager tracking act progression and key decisions
4. Create three possible ending paths based on corruption and choices
5. Implement Elysia trust system influencing guidance and story reveals
6. Develop cinematic sequence system for key story moments
7. Create save/load system for narrative state persistence

Code structure:
```csharp
public class DialogueManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private TextAsset dialogueDatabase;
    
    private Dictionary<string, DialogueNode> dialogueNodes;
    
    public void StartDialogue(string nodeId);
    public void MakeChoice(int choiceIndex);
    private void ApplyChoiceConsequences(DialogueChoice choice);
}

public class StoryManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private int currentAct = 1;
    
    private Dictionary<string, bool> keyDecisions = new Dictionary<string, bool>();
    private float elysiasTrust = 50f; // 0-100 scale
    
    public void AdvanceToNextAct();
    public void RecordDecision(string decisionId, bool choice);
    public void ModifyElysiasTrust(float amount);
    public string DetermineEnding();
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for DialogueManager and StoryManager
2. Verify branching dialogue paths function correctly
3. Test corruption and trust consequences from choices
4. Validate all three ending paths are reachable
5. Test Elysia trust system effects on guidance
6. Verify cinematic sequence triggering
7. Test save/load functionality for narrative state
