# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize Performance Across Platforms
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to achieve target frame rates (60 FPS on PC/PS5/Xbox, 30 FPS on Switch) and loading times under 5 seconds between areas.
# Details:
1. Implement level of detail (LOD) system for environment assets
2. Create asset streaming system for seamless world loading
3. Develop memory management system to stay under 4GB RAM on consoles
4. Implement occlusion culling for complex environments
5. Create platform-specific graphics settings presets
6. Optimize particle systems and visual effects
7. Implement texture compression strategies for each platform
8. Create loading screen system with progress indicators

Code structure:
```csharp
public class PerformanceManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private RuntimePlatform targetPlatform;
    [SerializeField] private int targetFrameRate;
    
    private void ApplyPlatformSpecificSettings();
    private void MonitorPerformance();
    private void AdjustDynamicSettings(float currentFPS);
}

public class AssetStreamer : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private float streamingDistance = 50f;
    [SerializeField] private Transform playerTransform;
    
    private List<StreamingArea> streamingAreas;
    
    private void UpdateStreamingAreas();
    private IEnumerator LoadAreaAsync(StreamingArea area);
    private IEnumerator UnloadAreaAsync(StreamingArea area);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance profiling on all target platforms
2. Verify frame rate targets are met (60 FPS on PC/PS5/Xbox, 30 FPS on Switch)
3. Test loading times between areas (target: under 5 seconds)
4. Validate memory usage stays under 4GB on console platforms
5. Test asset streaming with rapid player movement
6. Verify occlusion culling effectiveness in complex scenes
7. Performance testing during intense combat with multiple effects
