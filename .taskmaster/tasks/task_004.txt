# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Multi-Branch Skill Progression System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the character progression system with 15 abilities across Wraith, Hollow, and Arcanum branches, including memory fragment collection and corruption-level effects.
# Details:
1. Design data structure for 15 abilities across 3 branches (Wraith, Hollow, Arcanum)
2. Implement SkillTree class to manage ability unlocks and prerequisites
3. Create MemoryFragment collection system for Soulstone abilities
4. Develop cross-branch synergy system with prerequisite chains
5. Implement corruption level tracking affecting ability availability
6. Create UI visualization for skill trees as branching plant growth
7. Develop save/load system for progression persistence

Code structure:
```csharp
public enum SkillBranch { Wraith, Hollow, Arcanum }

[System.Serializable]
public class Ability {
    public string Id;
    public string Name;
    public string Description;
    public SkillBranch Branch;
    public List<string> Prerequisites;
    public int CorruptionRequirement;
    public bool IsForbidden;
    public UnityEvent OnActivated;
}

public class ProgressionManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private List<Ability> allAbilities;
    private List<string> unlockedAbilities = new List<string>();
    private int memoryFragments;
    private float corruptionLevel;
    
    public bool UnlockAbility(string abilityId);
    public bool CanUnlockAbility(string abilityId);
    public void CollectMemoryFragment();
    public void ModifyCorruption(float amount);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for ProgressionManager and ability unlock logic
2. Verify prerequisite chains function correctly
3. Test corruption level effects on ability availability
4. Validate memory fragment collection and Soulstone abilities
5. Test cross-branch synergy activation
6. Verify save/load functionality for progression data
7. UI visualization testing for skill tree representation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Skill Tree Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a data structure to represent the skill tree, including nodes, connections, and skill properties.
### Details:
Define classes or structures for skills, branches, and the overall tree. Include properties such as skill name, description, level, prerequisites, and effects.

## 2. Implement UI Representation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the user interface to visually represent the skill tree and allow player interaction.
### Details:
Create a scalable and intuitive UI that displays skills as nodes, connections as lines, and allows zooming and panning. Implement click/tap functionality for skill selection and information display.

## 3. Develop Skill Activation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a system to handle skill activation, deactivation, and level progression.
### Details:
Implement methods to activate skills, check prerequisites, handle skill point allocation, and update the player's active skills. Include validation to prevent illegal skill activations.

## 4. Implement Gameplay Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Integrate skill effects into the game's core mechanics and systems.
### Details:
Create a flexible system to apply skill effects to relevant game systems (e.g., combat, crafting, exploration). Ensure effects are properly scaled with skill levels and can be easily modified or expanded.

## 5. Balance Skill Tree [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Analyze and adjust skill values, costs, and effects for game balance.
### Details:
Conduct playtesting and data analysis to identify overpowered or underpowered skills. Adjust skill point costs, effect magnitudes, and progression paths to ensure a balanced and engaging experience.

## 6. Implement Save/Load System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Develop functionality to save and load skill tree progress.
### Details:
Create methods to serialize and deserialize the skill tree state, including activated skills, levels, and available skill points. Integrate with the game's overall save/load system.

## 7. Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4, 4.6
### Description: Analyze and improve the performance of the skill tree system.
### Details:
Profile the skill tree implementation, identifying any performance bottlenecks. Optimize data structures, algorithms, and UI rendering to ensure smooth performance, especially with large skill trees.
