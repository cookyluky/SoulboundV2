# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Boss Battle System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create three multi-phase boss battles with environmental interactions, unique reward drops, and adaptive AI patterns responding to player progression.
# Details:
1. Design base Boss class extending from Enemy
2. Implement phase transition system for multi-stage battles
3. Create environmental interaction mechanics for boss arenas
4. Develop unique reward drop system (fragments, abilities, equipment)
5. Implement adaptive AI patterns based on player's collected fragments
6. Create boss-specific animations and visual effects
7. Develop dynamic difficulty scaling based on player progression

Code structure:
```csharp
public abstract class Boss : Enemy {
    [SerializeField] protected int totalPhases = 3;
    [SerializeField] protected List<BossReward> phaseRewards;
    
    protected int currentPhase = 1;
    protected List<GameObject> environmentalHazards;
    
    public event Action<int> OnPhaseChanged;
    
    protected abstract void TransitionToNextPhase();
    protected abstract void ActivateEnvironmentalHazard(int hazardIndex);
    protected virtual void AdaptToPlayerProgression(ProgressionManager playerProgression);
    protected virtual void DropRewards();
}

[System.Serializable]
public class BossReward {
    public enum RewardType { Fragment, Ability, Equipment }
    
    public RewardType Type;
    public string RewardId;
    public GameObject VisualPrefab;
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for Boss class functionality
2. Verify phase transition mechanics
3. Test environmental hazard interactions
4. Validate reward drop system
5. Test adaptive AI based on player progression
6. Performance testing during boss battles with effects
7. Playtest boss encounters for difficulty balance
8. Verify boss animations and visual effects
