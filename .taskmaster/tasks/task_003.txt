# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Third-Person Combat System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core third-person melee combat system with dodge, block, and spirit-infused attack combinations, stamina-based action economy, and parry mechanics.
# Details:
1. Create PlayerCombatController with input handling for attacks, dodges, blocks
2. Implement stamina system with regeneration mechanics
3. Develop hit detection and damage calculation systems
4. Create combo system for spirit-infused attack combinations
5. Implement parry system with slow-motion counterattack opportunities
6. Develop environmental hazard integration affecting all entities
7. Create animation state machine for combat actions
8. Implement camera control optimized for combat

Code structure:
```csharp
public class PlayerCombatController : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private float maxStamina = 100f;
    [SerializeField] private float staminaRegenRate = 10f;
    [SerializeField] private float dodgeCost = 20f;
    [SerializeField] private float attackCost = 15f;
    
    private float currentStamina;
    private bool isBlocking;
    private int comboCounter;
    
    public void Attack();
    public void Dodge();
    public void Block(bool isBlocking);
    public bool TryParry(Attack incomingAttack);
    private void RegenerateStamina();
}

public class ParrySystem : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private float parryWindow = 0.2f;
    [SerializeField] private float slowMotionFactor = 0.3f;
    
    public void TriggerSlowMotion();
    public void EndSlowMotion();
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for combat mechanics and stamina system
2. Playtest dodge, block, and attack combinations
3. Verify parry timing windows and slow-motion effects
4. Test stamina regeneration rates and action costs
5. Validate environmental hazard interactions
6. Performance testing during intense combat scenarios
7. Controller and keyboard/mouse input validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Basic Character Movement [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core movement system for characters including walking, running, and directional controls.
### Details:
Implement character controller with appropriate physics, ensure smooth movement with acceleration/deceleration, add animation transitions between movement states, and implement camera following logic.

## 2. Develop Basic Attack System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the fundamental attack mechanics including light and heavy attacks with appropriate animations and hit detection.
### Details:
Implement attack input handling, create attack animations, develop hit detection system using raycasts or colliders, add basic damage calculation, and create visual/audio feedback for successful hits.

## 3. Implement Dodging Mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a dodge/roll system that allows players to evade attacks with appropriate invincibility frames.
### Details:
Implement dodge input handling, create dodge animations, add invincibility frame system during appropriate animation frames, implement dodge cooldown, and create visual effects for dodging.

## 4. Develop Blocking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement a blocking mechanic that reduces incoming damage and potentially staggers attackers.
### Details:
Create block input handling, implement damage reduction calculations, add block animations and effects, develop block stamina system, and implement perfect block timing mechanics for advanced players.

## 5. Create Combat Stats System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Develop the underlying stats system that powers combat, including health, stamina, and spirit energy.
### Details:
Implement health system with damage handling, create stamina system for attacks/dodges/blocks, develop spirit energy accumulation mechanics, add UI elements to display all stats, and implement regeneration logic.

## 6. Implement Spirit-Infused Abilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Create special abilities powered by spirit energy that provide powerful combat options.
### Details:
Design 3-5 unique spirit abilities, implement spirit energy consumption, create special effects and animations for each ability, add cooldown systems, and balance damage/utility of each ability.

## 7. Develop Enemy AI Combat Behaviors [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6
### Description: Create AI systems for enemies to engage in combat using the implemented mechanics.
### Details:
Implement enemy attack patterns, create AI decision making for different combat situations, add difficulty scaling, implement enemy use of special abilities, and create varied enemy types with different combat styles.

## 8. Combat System Testing and Balancing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
### Description: Test all combat mechanics for balance, responsiveness, and fun factor, making adjustments as needed.
### Details:
Create combat testing scenarios, gather feedback on feel and responsiveness, balance damage values and cooldowns, fix any bugs or inconsistencies, and polish animations and effects for maximum impact.
