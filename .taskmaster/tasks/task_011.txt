# Task ID: 11
# Title: Design and Implement UI System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the organic, nature-inspired UI system with seed pod interface elements, including menus, inventory, skill trees, and HUD elements with accessibility considerations.
# Details:
1. Design and implement seed pod menu emergence animations
2. Create inventory visualization with seeds within translucent pods
3. Develop skill tree visualization as branching plant growth
4. Implement notification system with blooming flower animations
5. Create HUD elements for health/stamina, essence counter, and corruption meter
6. Implement mini-map with environmental hazards and spirit signatures
7. Develop accessibility features including colorblind support and text scaling
8. Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes and platforms

Code structure:
```csharp
public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private GameObject mainMenuPod;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject inventoryPod;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject skillTreePod;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject notificationPrefab;
    
    public void OpenMenu(MenuType type);
    public void CloseMenu(MenuType type);
    public void ShowNotification(string message, NotificationType type);
    public void UpdateHUD(PlayerStats stats);
}

public class AccessibilityManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private ColorBlindMode colorBlindMode;
    [SerializeField] private float textScale = 1f;
    [SerializeField] private bool highContrastMode;
    
    public void ApplyAccessibilitySettings();
    public void SetColorBlindMode(ColorBlindMode mode);
    public void SetTextScale(float scale);
    public void ToggleHighContrastMode(bool enabled);
}

public enum ColorBlindMode { None, Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia }
public enum MenuType { Main, Inventory, SkillTree, Map, Settings }
public enum NotificationType { Info, Warning, Achievement, Quest }
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify UI animations and transitions
2. Test UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
3. Validate accessibility features including colorblind modes
4. Test controller and keyboard/mouse navigation
5. Verify touch input support for Nintendo Switch
6. Performance testing with multiple UI elements active
7. Usability testing for menu navigation and information clarity
