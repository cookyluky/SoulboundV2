# Task ID: 25
# Title: Configure Quality and Build Settings Baseline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish standardized render, quality, and platform settings for the project by configuring the URP asset, defining quality profiles, and setting up proper build configurations.
# Details:
1. **URP Asset Configuration** (`Assets/Settings/`):
   - Create a new Universal Render Pipeline asset if not already present
   - Configure post-processing settings (bloom, color grading, ambient occlusion)
   - Set up shadow quality parameters (resolution, distance, cascades)
   - Enable HDR rendering for improved visual fidelity
   - Configure anti-aliasing settings (FXAA or MSAA)

2. **Quality Settings Profiles**:
   - Open Project Settings > Quality
   - Define four distinct quality profiles:
     * **Low**: Optimized for low-end devices (mobile, Switch)
       - Disable post-processing effects
       - Reduce shadow resolution and distance
       - Lower texture quality and anisotropic filtering
     * **Medium**: Balanced performance for mid-range hardware
       - Basic post-processing effects
       - Medium shadow quality
       - Medium texture resolution and filtering
     * **High**: Enhanced visuals for modern consoles and decent PCs
       - Full post-processing suite
       - High shadow quality with 2 cascades
       - High texture resolution with 4x anisotropic filtering
     * **Ultra**: Maximum quality for high-end PCs
       - All post-processing effects at maximum quality
       - High shadow resolution with 4 cascades
       - Maximum texture resolution with 16x anisotropic filtering
   - Set appropriate default quality level per platform

3. **Build Settings Configuration**:
   - Open Build Settings (File > Build Settings)
   - Add the following scenes to the build:
     * `Bootstrap.unity` (index 0)
     * `MainMenu.unity` (index 1)
     * `PrototypeLevel.unity` (index 2)
   - Set company name to project company
   - Set product name to "Soulbinder"
   - Configure appropriate bundle identifiers for each platform
   - Set default icons for the application

4. **Scripting Backend Configuration**:
   - Set Scripting Backend to IL2CPP for improved performance and security
   - Configure .NET Standard 2.1 compatibility level
   - Enable appropriate API compatibility level
   - Configure appropriate stripping level for each platform

5. **Create Documentation**:
   - Document all settings in a README.md file in the `Assets/Settings/` folder
   - Include screenshots of final configurations
   - Document the rationale behind quality profile decisions

# Test Strategy:
1. **URP Asset Verification**:
   - Open the URP asset in the Inspector and confirm all settings match specifications
   - Create a test scene with various lighting conditions to verify shadow quality
   - Test HDR rendering with high-contrast lighting scenarios
   - Verify post-processing effects are working as expected

2. **Quality Settings Validation**:
   - Switch between each quality profile in the editor and verify visual differences
   - Take screenshots of the same scene in each quality level for comparison
   - Measure and document performance metrics (FPS) for each quality level
   - Verify platform-specific default quality settings are appropriate

3. **Build Settings Testing**:
   - Perform a test build to verify all scenes are included correctly
   - Confirm the build launches and transitions from Bootstrap to MainMenu correctly
   - Verify company name, product name, and icons appear correctly in the built application
   - Test on each target platform to ensure platform-specific settings are applied

4. **Scripting Backend Validation**:
   - Verify IL2CPP compilation works without errors
   - Test .NET Standard 2.1 compatibility with existing code
   - Confirm API compatibility level doesn't cause issues with third-party plugins
   - Measure build times and final build sizes to ensure they meet requirements

5. **Cross-Platform Testing**:
   - Test the configuration on at least one device/emulator for each target platform
   - Verify graphics settings are appropriate for each platform's capabilities
   - Document any platform-specific issues or considerations
