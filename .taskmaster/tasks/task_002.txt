# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Soul-Binding System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the fundamental soul essence absorption mechanics that allow players to absorb essences from defeated enemies for health/stamina restoration or banking for upgrades.
# Details:
1. Create SoulEssence class with properties for type, quantity, and effects
2. Implement EssenceManager singleton to track collected essences
3. Develop absorption mechanics with timing window (3 seconds post-enemy defeat)
4. Create visual particle effects and audio feedback for absorption events
5. Implement decision system for immediate consumption vs. banking
6. Design UI indicators for essence types and quantities
7. Develop scaling absorption rate based on player progression
8. Create data structures for essence inventory management

Code structure:
```csharp
public enum EssenceType { Vitality, Strength, Arcane, Forbidden }

public class SoulEssence {
    public EssenceType Type { get; private set; }
    public float Quantity { get; private set; }
    public float AbsorptionRate { get; private set; }
    
    // Methods for consumption and banking
}

public class EssenceManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private Dictionary<EssenceType, float> bankedEssence;
    
    public void AbsorbEssence(SoulEssence essence, bool consumeImmediately);
    public float GetBankedEssence(EssenceType type);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for SoulEssence and EssenceManager classes
2. Verify absorption timing window functions correctly
3. Test visual and audio feedback systems
4. Validate essence tracking and inventory management
5. Playtest immediate consumption vs. banking decision points
6. Performance testing with multiple simultaneous essence absorptions
7. Verify scaling absorption rate with player progression
