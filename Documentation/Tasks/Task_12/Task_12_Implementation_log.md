## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
The save system will use a layered approach for maximum reliability:
- **Local Layer**: Encrypted save files stored on device
- **Cloud Layer**: Firebase Cloud Storage for backup and sync
- **Platform Layer**: Integration with platform-specific cloud saves (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch)
- **Security Layer**: AES-256 encryption and integrity verification

### Data Flow Design
1. **Save Operation**: Game state → SaveData object → JSON serialization → AES encryption → Local file + Cloud upload
2. **Load Operation**: Local file check → Decryption → Deserialization → Game state restoration
3. **Sync Operation**: Compare timestamps → Conflict resolution → Merge or replace → Update local/cloud

### Security Considerations
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All save data encrypted before leaving the device
- **Key Management**: Per-user encryption keys derived from secure device identifiers
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 checksums to detect corruption
- **Access Control**: User authentication required for cloud features

## Performance Impact

### Anticipated Performance Considerations
- **Save Operation Time**: Target <2 seconds for local saves, <10 seconds for cloud sync
- **File Size**: Compressed save data should be <500KB for efficient network transfer
- **Memory Usage**: Keep save operations under 50MB RAM to avoid performance impact
- **Background Operations**: Cloud sync should not affect gameplay frame rate

### Performance Targets
- Local save operation: <2 seconds
- Cloud sync operation: <10 seconds on average
- Save file compression: 60%+ size reduction
- Memory footprint: <50MB during save operations
- Save file integrity: 99.9% success rate

## Dependencies and Integration

### Integration Points
- **Game State Manager**: Source of all save data across game systems
- **Player Progression System**: Stats, abilities, and experience data
- **Quest System**: Quest progress and completion status
- **Inventory System**: Item quantities and soul essence totals
- **World State Manager**: Environmental changes and discovered locations
- **Settings Manager**: Player preferences and accessibility options

### External Dependencies
- Firebase SDK for Unity
- Platform-specific cloud save SDKs (Steamworks, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo)
- AES encryption libraries
- JSON serialization framework

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Research platform-specific save requirements and limitations
   - Study Firebase Cloud Storage capabilities and pricing
   - Define comprehensive save data requirements for all game systems
   - Create data flow diagrams for all save/load scenarios

2. **Technical Setup**
   - Set up Firebase project with Cloud Storage enabled
   - Configure Unity project with Firebase SDK
   - Set up platform-specific development environments for testing
   - Create base SaveManager class structure

3. **Data Structure Design**
   - Define SaveData class with all required game state information
   - Create JSON schema for save file format validation
   - Design compression strategies for network efficiency
   - Plan version control for save file format evolution

### Design Questions to Resolve
- How should we handle save file format changes between game versions?
- What's the optimal auto-save frequency to balance convenience and performance?
- How should conflict resolution present choices to players?
- What fallback strategies should we implement when cloud services are unavailable?

### Security Considerations to Address
- How to securely generate and store encryption keys per user?
- What additional verification methods should we implement beyond checksums?
- How to handle cloud authentication failures gracefully?
- What data should we log for debugging without compromising privacy?
