## Technical Requirements

### Core Classes
```csharp
public class QuestManager : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private List<Quest> availableQuests;
    
    private Dictionary<string, QuestState> questStates = new Dictionary<string, QuestState>();
    private Dictionary<string, float> factionReputation = new Dictionary<string, float>();
    
    public void StartQuest(string questId);
    public void UpdateQuestObjective(string questId, string objectiveId);
    public void CompleteQuest(string questId);
    public void ModifyFactionReputation(string factionId, float amount);
    public float GetFactionReputation(string factionId);
}

[System.Serializable]
public class Quest {
    public string Id;
    public string Title;
    public string Description;
    public List<QuestObjective> Objectives;
    public List<QuestReward> Rewards;
    public List<QuestChoice> MoralChoices;
}

public enum QuestState { NotStarted, InProgress, Completed, Failed }
```

### Integration Points
- **Narrative System**: Quest dialogue and story integration
- **UI System**: Quest markers, tracking, and progress displays
- **Save System**: Quest state persistence and faction reputation
- **Corruption System**: Moral choices affecting corruption levels
- **Progression System**: Quest rewards influencing character development

## Success Criteria
- [ ] QuestManager tracking all quest states correctly
- [ ] Eight unique side quests fully implemented and tested
- [ ] Moral choice consequences affecting world state

## Risk Factors
- **Narrative Complexity**: Eight quests with branching outcomes may create inconsistencies
- **Faction Balance**: Reputation system may create impossible gameplay scenarios
- **Hidden Lore Integration**: Contradictions must be subtle enough to maintain story cohesion
- **Technical Debt**: Complex quest state management may impact performance
