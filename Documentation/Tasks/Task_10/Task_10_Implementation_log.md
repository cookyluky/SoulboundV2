## Implementation Notes
*This section will be updated with detailed implementation notes as work progresses*

### Key Implementation Considerations
- **Quest State Management**: Complex state tracking across eight quests with branching outcomes
- **Faction Reputation**: Balanced reputation system that doesn't lock players out of content
- **Hidden Lore Integration**: Subtle revelation of guidance system contradictions
- **Player Choice Impact**: Meaningful consequences that affect world state and future quests

### Quest Architecture Planning
- **QuestManager**: Centralized quest state management and progression tracking
- **Quest Data Structure**: Flexible system supporting branching narratives and multiple outcomes
- **Faction System**: Reputation tracking with influence on NPC interactions and quest availability
- **Lore Discovery**: Hidden narrative elements that reward exploration and investigation

## Challenges Encountered
*This section will document any challenges, blockers, or issues encountered during implementation*

### Anticipated Challenges
- **Narrative Consistency**: Maintaining coherent storytelling across eight branching quests
- **State Management Complexity**: Tracking quest states, faction reputation, and choice consequences
- **Balance Issues**: Ensuring faction reputation system doesn't create impossible scenarios
- **Integration Complexity**: Seamlessly weaving side quests into main narrative flow

## Solutions and Workarounds
*This section will document solutions to problems and any workarounds implemented*

## Code Changes Summary
*This section will track major code changes, file additions, and system modifications*

### Planned File Structure
- `Scripts/Quests/QuestManager.cs` - Core quest management system
- `Scripts/Quests/Quest.cs` - Quest data structure and behavior
- `Scripts/Quests/QuestObjective.cs` - Individual quest objective handling
- `Scripts/Quests/QuestReward.cs` - Reward system and distribution
- `Scripts/Quests/FactionManager.cs` - Faction reputation tracking
- `Scripts/Quests/LoreManager.cs` - Hidden lore discovery system
- `Scripts/UI/QuestUI.cs` - Quest tracking and UI elements
- `Scripts/Dialogue/QuestDialogue.cs` - Quest-specific dialogue system

## Testing Results
*This section will document testing outcomes and validation results*

### Planned Testing Approach
- **Quest Flow Testing**: Verify all quest paths and branching narratives
- **State Persistence Testing**: Ensure quest states save/load correctly
- **Faction Reputation Testing**: Validate reputation impacts on gameplay
- **Lore Discovery Testing**: Confirm hidden elements are discoverable and meaningful
- **Integration Testing**: Verify seamless integration with main narrative
- **Balance Testing**: Ensure quest rewards are appropriately balanced

## Performance Impact
*This section will track any performance implications of the implementation*

### Performance Targets
- **Quest State Processing**: < 5ms for quest state updates
- **Faction Reputation Calculations**: < 1ms per reputation change
- **Quest UI Updates**: < 100ms for quest log and marker updates
- **Memory Usage**: Quest data should not exceed 100MB in memory
- **Save Data**: Quest states should add < 10MB to save file size

## Dependencies and Integration
*This section will document how this task integrates with other systems and tasks*

### Required Integrations
- **Task 1**: Unity project setup and core framework
- **Task 9**: Narrative and choice system for dialogue integration
- **Task 11**: UI system for quest tracking and markers
- **Task 12**: Save system for quest state persistence
- **Task 6**: Corruption system for moral choice consequences

### Integration Points
- **Dialogue System**: Quest-specific conversations and choice outcomes
- **Save System**: Persistent quest states and faction reputation
- **UI System**: Quest tracking, progress bars, and objective markers
- **Audio System**: Quest-specific dialogue and ambient audio cues
- **Corruption System**: Moral choices affecting corruption levels

## Next Steps
*This section will outline immediate next steps for implementation*

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (Week 1)
1. Design and implement QuestManager core functionality
2. Create Quest and QuestObjective data structures
3. Implement basic quest state tracking
4. Design faction reputation system architecture

### Phase 2: Quest Content Creation (Weeks 2-3)
1. Write quest narratives and dialogue for all eight side quests
2. Implement quest trigger conditions and activation systems
3. Create branching dialogue trees and choice outcomes
4. Develop hidden lore elements and discovery mechanics

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (Weeks 4-5)
1. Integrate quest system with UI and dialogue systems
2. Implement quest rewards and progression integration
3. Balance faction reputation impacts and consequences
4. Test all quest paths and debug edge cases
5. Polish quest presentation and user experience
