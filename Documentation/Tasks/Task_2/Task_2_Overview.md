# Task 2 Overview: Implement Core Soul-Binding System

## Task Description
Develop the fundamental soul essence absorption mechanics that allow players to absorb essences from defeated enemies for health/stamina restoration or banking for upgrades.

## Priority Level
**High** - Core gameplay mechanic that defines the unique identity of SoulBound.

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Setup Unity Project with Required SDKs

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Objectives
1. **Soul Essence System Architecture**
   - Create SoulEssence class with properties for type, quantity, and effects
   - Implement EssenceManager singleton for centralized essence tracking
   - Design scaling absorption mechanics based on player progression

2. **Absorption Mechanics**
   - Develop timing-based absorption (3-second window post-enemy defeat)
   - Create visual particle effects and audio feedback
   - Implement decision system for immediate consumption vs. banking

3. **Essence Types and Effects**
   - Vitality essences for health restoration
   - Strength essences for combat enhancement
   - Arcane essences for magical abilities
   - Forbidden essences for corruption-based powers

4. **Data Management**
   - Design essence inventory system
   - Implement save/load functionality for essence data
   - Create UI indicators for essence types and quantities

## Technical Requirements

### Core Classes
```csharp
public enum EssenceType { Vitality, Strength, Arcane, Forbidden }

public class SoulEssence {
    public EssenceType Type { get; private set; }
    public float Quantity { get; private set; }
    public float AbsorptionRate { get; private set; }
}

public class EssenceManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private Dictionary<EssenceType, float> bankedEssence;
    
    public void AbsorbEssence(SoulEssence essence, bool consumeImmediately);
    public float GetBankedEssence(EssenceType type);
}
```

### Integration Points
- Combat System: Trigger essence release on enemy death
- Progression System: Scale absorption rates with player level
- Corruption System: Handle forbidden essence consequences
- UI System: Display essence indicators and decision prompts

## Success Criteria
- [ ] SoulEssence and EssenceManager classes implemented
- [ ] 3-second absorption timing window functions correctly
- [ ] Visual and audio feedback systems active
- [ ] All four essence types (Vitality, Strength, Arcane, Forbidden) working
- [ ] Immediate consumption vs. banking choice system operational
- [ ] Essence inventory management fully functional
- [ ] Save/load system preserves essence data
- [ ] Scaling absorption rate based on progression implemented
- [ ] UI indicators display essence information clearly

## Risk Factors
- **Performance Impact**: Multiple essence absorptions may cause framerate drops
- **Balance Complexity**: Essence values may require extensive balancing
- **Save System Integration**: Complex data structures may complicate save/load
- **Visual Clarity**: Essence particles may obscure gameplay visibility

## Related Systems
- **Combat System**: Enemy death triggers and essence release
- **Progression System**: Player level affects absorption efficiency
- **Corruption System**: Forbidden essence handling and consequences
- **UI System**: Essence meters, decision prompts, and inventory displays
- **Save System**: Persistence of essence data across sessions

## Estimated Completion Time
**3-4 weeks** - Includes design, implementation, integration, balancing, and testing phases.
