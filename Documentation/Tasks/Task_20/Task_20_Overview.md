# Task 20 Overview: ScriptableObject Data Definitions

## Task Description
Create foundational ScriptableObject data definitions for game configuration, item systems, character stats, and game settings. This establishes the data-driven architecture that will support flexible game balancing and content creation throughout development.

## Priority Level
**High** - ScriptableObjects form the backbone of data-driven design and are required by multiple downstream systems including UI, combat, progression, and content management.

## Dependencies
- Task 17: Core Manager Singletons

## Detailed Breakdown
This task establishes the fundamental data structures that will drive game mechanics and content. ScriptableObjects provide Unity's recommended approach for data-driven design, allowing designers to modify game parameters without code changes while maintaining asset references and serialization benefits.

### Core Data Categories
1. **Character Stats & Progression**
   - Base character attributes (health, stamina, spirit energy)
   - Leveling curves and progression formulas
   - Skill trees and ability definitions

2. **Item & Equipment System**
   - Weapon definitions with damage, spirit affinity, and special properties
   - Armor and accessory statistics
   - Consumable items with effects and descriptions

3. **Game Configuration**
   - Difficulty scaling parameters
   - Balance settings for combat mechanics
   - Audio and visual effect configurations

4. **UI & Localization Data**
   - Text definitions for internationalization
   - UI theme and styling parameters
   - Menu configuration data

## Technical Requirements

### ScriptableObject Architecture
- Implement base ScriptableObject classes with common functionality
- Create specialized data containers for different game systems
- Establish naming conventions and organization patterns
- Implement validation and error checking for data integrity

### Asset Organization
- Create dedicated folders for different data types under `Assets/Data/`
- Implement custom PropertyDrawers for complex data types
- Establish asset naming conventions (e.g., `CharStat_PlayerBase`, `Weapon_SoulSword`)
- Create template assets for rapid content creation

### Integration Points
- Design data interfaces that managers can consume
- Implement runtime data loading and caching systems
- Create editor tools for data validation and bulk operations
- Establish data migration strategies for future updates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Base ScriptableObject classes created with proper inheritance hierarchy
- [ ] Character stat definitions implemented with validation
- [ ] Weapon and item data structures completed
- [ ] Game configuration ScriptableObjects functional
- [ ] Asset organization structure established in Unity
- [ ] Custom PropertyDrawers implemented for complex types
- [ ] Editor validation tools created and functional
- [ ] Template assets created for each data type
- [ ] Integration interfaces defined for manager consumption
- [ ] Documentation created for data creation workflows

## Risk Factors

### Data Architecture Risks
- **Over-engineering data structures** leading to complexity without benefit
- **Insufficient validation** causing runtime errors from malformed data
- **Poor organization** making data assets difficult to find and maintain

### Performance Considerations
- **Large data assets** potentially impacting load times
- **Inefficient data queries** during runtime operations
- **Memory usage** from keeping all data loaded simultaneously

### Workflow Risks
- **Complex editor workflows** slowing down content creation
- **Data migration issues** when structures need to change
- **Version control conflicts** in binary asset files

## Related Systems
This task integrates with multiple game systems:

- **Combat System (Task 3)**: Weapon and character stat definitions
- **UI System (Task 6)**: Display data and localization text
- **Save/Load System (Task 19)**: Persistent data structures
- **Audio System**: Sound effect and music configuration data
- **Scene Management**: Level configuration and progression data

## Estimated Completion Time
**3-4 days** - This includes designing the architecture, implementing base classes, creating specific data types, setting up asset organization, and building initial template assets. The data-driven foundation requires careful planning to avoid technical debt.

## Implementation Strategy
