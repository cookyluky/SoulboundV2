# Task 3 Overview: Develop Third-Person Combat System

## Task Description
Implement the core third-person melee combat system with dodge, block, and spirit-infused attack combinations, stamina-based action economy, and parry mechanics.

## Priority Level
**High** - Essential gameplay foundation that players will interact with constantly.

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Setup Unity Project with Required SDKs

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Combat Mechanics
1. **Basic Combat Actions**
   - Light and heavy attacks with distinct timing and damage
   - Dodge/roll system with invincibility frames
   - Block system with damage reduction and stamina cost
   - Parry system with slow-motion counterattack windows

2. **Stamina System**
   - Stamina-based action economy for all combat actions
   - Regeneration mechanics with tactical considerations
   - Stamina costs balanced for strategic gameplay

3. **Spirit-Infused Abilities**
   - Special attack combinations powered by spirit energy
   - Unique visual and mechanical effects
   - Integration with soul essence system

4. **Combat Feedback**
   - Hit detection and damage calculation
   - Visual and audio feedback for all actions
   - Camera effects for impact and flow

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes
```csharp
public class PlayerCombatController : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private float maxStamina = 100f;
    [SerializeField] private float staminaRegenRate = 10f;
    [SerializeField] private float dodgeCost = 20f;
    [SerializeField] private float attackCost = 15f;
    
    private float currentStamina;
    private bool isBlocking;
    private int comboCounter;
    
    public void Attack();
    public void Dodge();
    public void Block(bool isBlocking);
    public bool TryParry(Attack incomingAttack);
    private void RegenerateStamina();
}

public class ParrySystem : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private float parryWindow = 0.2f;
    [SerializeField] private float slowMotionFactor = 0.3f;
    
    public void TriggerSlowMotion();
    public void EndSlowMotion();
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Responsive third-person combat controls
- [ ] Balanced stamina system with strategic depth
- [ ] Satisfying hit detection and feedback
- [ ] Spirit-infused combo system functional
- [ ] Parry mechanics with slow-motion effects
- [ ] Performance targets met during combat
- [ ] Camera system optimized for combat flow

## Estimated Completion Time
**4-5 weeks** - Core combat is complex and requires extensive testing and polish.
