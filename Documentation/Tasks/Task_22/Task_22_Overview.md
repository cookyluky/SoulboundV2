# Task 22 Overview: Lighting & Camera Setup

## Task Description
Establish comprehensive lighting systems and camera configurations that support the game's visual atmosphere, performance requirements, and gameplay needs. This includes setting up lighting pipelines, camera controllers, and visual effects that enhance the dark fantasy aesthetic of SoulBound.

## Priority Level
**High** - Lighting and camera systems are fundamental to visual quality, performance optimization, and player experience. These systems affect all visible aspects of the game and must be established early in development.

## Dependencies
- Task 16: Bootstrap Scene & Service Locator
- Task 22: Lighting & Camera Setup
- Task 23: Core Prefabs

## Detailed Breakdown
This task creates the visual foundation for SoulBound's dark fantasy atmosphere through carefully configured lighting systems and camera controllers. The implementation must balance visual quality with performance while supporting dynamic gameplay elements and atmospheric storytelling.

### Lighting System Components
1. **Global Lighting Configuration**
   - Environment lighting setup with skybox and ambient settings
   - Directional light configuration for primary illumination
   - Shadow casting and receiving optimization
   - Light culling and LOD systems for performance

2. **Dynamic Lighting Systems**
   - Point lights for torches, magical effects, and environmental features
   - Spot lights for focused illumination and dramatic effects
   - Area lights for soft environmental lighting
   - Light pooling system for performance optimization

3. **Atmospheric Lighting**
   - Fog and atmospheric scattering effects
   - Volumetric lighting for dramatic visual impact
   - Color grading and tone mapping for consistent visual style
   - Day/night cycle foundation (if applicable)

### Camera System Architecture
1. **Main Camera Controller**
   - Third-person camera with smooth following mechanics
   - Camera collision detection and obstacle avoidance
   - Dynamic field of view adjustments for gameplay situations
   - Smooth rotation and movement interpolation

2. **Camera State Management**
   - Multiple camera modes (exploration, combat, cinematic)
   - Smooth transitions between camera states
   - Camera shake and impact effects system
   - Lock-on targeting camera behavior

3. **Rendering Pipeline Configuration**
   - Post-processing stack configuration
   - Render pipeline settings optimization
   - Multi-camera setup for UI and world rendering
   - Performance scaling based on hardware capabilities

### Visual Quality Risks
- **Inconsistent lighting** across different areas and scenes
- **Camera clipping** through environment geometry during gameplay
- **Visual artifacts** from improper rendering pipeline configuration
- **Poor atmospheric effects** failing to support the intended dark fantasy mood

### Technical Risks
- **Pipeline compatibility** issues with existing and future systems
- **Platform-specific rendering** problems on different target devices
- **Memory usage** from high-resolution lighting and effects data
- **Integration complexity** with existing manager and controller systems
