## Implementation Notes

### Visual Style Goals
The lighting and camera systems must support SoulBound's dark fantasy aesthetic:
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Deep shadows with dramatic light sources
- **Performance Balance**: High visual quality without compromising frame rate
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Lighting that guides player attention and conveys mood
- **Responsive Camera**: Smooth, intuitive camera behavior that enhances gameplay

### Technical Architecture Strategy
1. **Universal Render Pipeline**: Leverage URP for optimal performance and visual quality
2. **Component-Based Design**: Modular camera and lighting components for flexibility
3. **State Management**: Clear separation of camera modes and lighting conditions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient culling, LOD, and pooling systems

### Integration Considerations
- **ServiceLocator**: Camera and lighting managers registration and access
- **Player Controller**: Camera following and targeting integration
- **Scene Management**: Lighting transitions between different areas
- **Audio System**: 3D audio positioning relative to camera position

- **Save System**: Camera preferences and lighting settings persistence
- **Environment System**: Dynamic lighting for environmental interactions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Once Task 16 is Complete)
1. **URP Configuration**: Set up Universal Render Pipeline with appropriate quality settings
2. **Lighting Architecture**: Design lighting manager and global lighting configuration
3. **Camera Foundation**: Create base camera controller with core functionality
4. **Performance Framework**: Establish optimization systems for lighting and rendering

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Lighting Setup (Phase 1)**:
   - Configure URP render pipeline settings
   - Set up global directional lighting and shadows
   - Implement ambient lighting and skybox configuration
   - Create basic light pooling system

2. **Camera Development (Phase 2)**:
   - Build third-person camera controller foundation
   - Implement smooth following and rotation mechanics
   - Add collision detection and obstacle avoidance
   - Create camera state management system

3. **Advanced Features (Phase 3)**:
   - Configure post-processing effects pipeline
   - Implement dynamic lighting management
   - Add multiple camera modes (exploration, combat)
   - Optimize performance and create documentation

### Testing and Validation Plan
1. **Visual Quality Testing**: Verify lighting atmosphere matches design goals
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure frame rate impact across target platforms
3. **Camera Behavior Testing**: Validate smooth movement and collision handling
4. **Integration Testing**: Test with player controller and scene transitions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Camera Controller Architecture
```csharp
public class ThirdPersonCameraController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform target;
    [SerializeField] private float followDistance = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private float rotationSpeed = 2f;
    [SerializeField] private float verticalOffset = 2f;
    
    // Collision detection
    [SerializeField] private LayerMask obstacleLayer;
    [SerializeField] private float collisionRadius = 0.3f;
    
    // Camera states
    public enum CameraState { Exploration, Combat, Cinematic }
    private CameraState currentState;
    
    // Smooth interpolation
    private Vector3 targetPosition;
    private Quaternion targetRotation;
    
    public void SetCameraState(CameraState newState);
    private void HandleCollisionDetection();
    private void UpdateCameraPosition();
    private void HandleCameraRotation();
}
```

### Lighting Manager System
```csharp
public class LightingManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Light mainDirectionalLight;
    [SerializeField] private RenderSettings ambientSettings;
    
    // Dynamic light pooling
    private Queue<Light> availableLights;
    private List<Light> activeLights;
    
    // Lighting presets for different areas
    [SerializeField] private LightingPreset[] areaPresets;
    
    public Light RequestLight(LightType type);
    public void ReturnLight(Light light);
    public void ApplyLightingPreset(string presetName);
    private void OptimizeLightingPerformance();
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Light Culling**: Distance-based light deactivation
- **Shadow Cascade Optimization**: Appropriate shadow distances for visual quality
- **LOD Integration**: Light quality scaling based on distance and importance
- **Render Pipeline Settings**: Balanced quality settings for target platforms
