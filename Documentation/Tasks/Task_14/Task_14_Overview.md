## Code Architecture

```csharp
// Steam Platform Service
public class SteamPlatformService : IPlatformService {
    private bool steamInitialized;
    
    public void Initialize() {
        steamInitialized = SteamAPI.Init();
        RegisterCallbacks();
    }
    
    public void UnlockAchievement(string achievementId) {
        if (steamInitialized) {
            SteamUserStats.SetAchievement(achievementId);
            SteamUserStats.StoreStats();
        }
    }
    
    public void UpdatePresence(string status) {
        SteamFriends.SetRichPresence("status", status);
    }
}

// PlayStation Platform Service
public class PlayStationPlatformService : IPlatformService {
    public void ApplyHapticFeedback(HapticEvent hapticEvent) {
        switch (hapticEvent.Type) {
            case HapticType.SoulAbsorption:
                ApplySoulAbsorptionFeedback(hapticEvent.Intensity);
                break;
            case HapticType.CombatImpact:
                ApplyCombatFeedback(hapticEvent.Direction, hapticEvent.Intensity);
                break;
        }
    }
    
    private void ApplyAdaptiveTriggers(TriggerEvent triggerEvent) {
        // Implementation for adaptive trigger resistance
    }
}

// Nintendo Switch Platform Service
public class SwitchPlatformService : IPlatformService {
    public void ApplyHapticFeedback(HapticEvent hapticEvent) {
        // HD Rumble implementation
        var rumbleData = ConvertToHDRumble(hapticEvent);
        NintendoSwitchInput.ApplyHDRumble(rumbleData);
    }
    
    public void HandleTouchInput(TouchInput touchInput) {
        // Process touch events for UI navigation
    }
