# Task 15 Overview: Implement Analytics and Privacy Compliance

## Task Description
Integrate Firebase Analytics for anonymous gameplay data tracking, implement secure user data management, and ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

## Priority Level
**Medium** - Essential for post-launch analysis and legal compliance, but not blocking for core gameplay.

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Setup Unity Project with Required SDKs

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Objectives
1. **Firebase Analytics Integration**
   - Integrate Firebase Analytics for anonymous data collection
   - Implement tracking for key gameplay metrics and progression milestones
   - Create event tracking for player choices and behavior patterns

2. **Gameplay Metrics Tracking**
   - Progression milestones and achievement tracking
   - Choice outcomes and narrative path analysis
   - Combat encounter statistics and difficulty assessment
   - Soul-binding usage patterns and efficiency metrics
   - Session duration and drop-off point analysis

3. **Privacy Compliance Framework**
   - Create privacy policy and consent management system
   - Implement data anonymization for all collected metrics
   - Develop opt-out functionality for analytics tracking
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and regional privacy regulations

4. **Data Management and Security**
   - Create data retention and deletion policies
   - Implement secure data transmission and storage
   - Develop user data request and deletion systems
   - Create audit trails for data processing activities

## Technical Requirements

### Core Classes
```csharp
public class AnalyticsManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private FirebaseAnalytics firebaseAnalytics;
    private bool analyticsEnabled;
    
    public void Initialize();
    public void SetAnalyticsEnabled(bool enabled);
    public void TrackProgressionEvent(string milestone);
    public void TrackChoiceEvent(string choiceId, string outcome);
    public void TrackCombatEvent(string enemyType, bool playerVictory, float duration);
    public void TrackSoulBindingEvent(string essenceType, bool banked);
    public void TrackSessionEvent(SessionEventType type, float duration);
}

public class PrivacyManager : MonoBehaviour {
    private bool userConsented;
    
    public void ShowPrivacyConsent();
    public void SetUserConsent(bool consent);
    public void DeleteUserData();
    public bool IsConsentRequired();
}

public enum SessionEventType { Start, End, Pause, Resume }
```

### Integration Points
- **Firebase Analytics**: Anonymous data collection and event tracking
- **UI System**: Privacy consent dialogs and settings panels
- **Save System**: User consent preferences and analytics settings
- **All Game Systems**: Event triggers for analytics data collection

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Firebase Analytics properly integrated and functional
- [ ] All key gameplay metrics tracked anonymously
- [ ] Privacy consent system operational and GDPR compliant
- [ ] Opt-out functionality disables all tracking effectively
- [ ] Data anonymization verified for all collected metrics
- [ ] User data deletion functionality implemented
- [ ] Privacy policy created and accessible in-game
- [ ] Analytics work correctly across all target platforms
- [ ] Data retention policies implemented and enforced
- [ ] Compliance verification completed for GDPR and CCPA

## Risk Factors
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Privacy laws vary by region and change frequently
- **Platform Restrictions**: Some platforms may limit analytics capabilities
- **Data Security**: Breaches could expose player data despite anonymization
- **Performance Impact**: Analytics tracking may affect game performance
- **User Trust**: Invasive tracking could damage player confidence

## Related Systems
- **Firebase Analytics**: Core data collection and analysis platform
- **UI System**: Privacy consent interfaces and settings panels
- **Save System**: User preferences and consent status persistence
- **All Gameplay Systems**: Event sources for analytics data
- **Platform Services**: Platform-specific analytics integrations

## Tracked Metrics Categories

### Progression Analytics
- **Level Completion**: Track which levels are completed and abandonment rates
- **Ability Usage**: Monitor which soul-binding abilities are most/least used
- **Corruption Paths**: Analyze player corruption level distributions
- **Quest Completion**: Side quest engagement and completion rates

### Player Behavior Analytics
- **Choice Patterns**: Dialogue and moral choice statistical analysis
- **Combat Performance**: Win/loss ratios and difficulty spike identification
- **Exploration Patterns**: Areas most/least visited and time spent
- **Session Patterns**: Play session length and frequency analysis

### Technical Performance Analytics
- **Crash Reports**: Anonymous crash data for stability improvements
- **Performance Metrics**: Frame rate and loading time analytics
- **Platform Usage**: Distribution across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch
- **Feature Usage**: Which game features are used most frequently

## Privacy Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance
- **Lawful Basis**: Legitimate interest for game improvement
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary analytics data
- **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **Right to Deletion**: User data deletion on request
- **Data Portability**: Export user data in standard formats

### CCPA Compliance
- **Disclosure**: Clear disclosure of data collection practices
- **Opt-Out Rights**: Easy opt-out mechanisms for California residents
- **Data Sale Prohibition**: No selling of personal information
- **Consumer Rights**: Right to know, delete, and opt-out

## Estimated Completion Time
**2-3 weeks** - Includes Firebase integration, privacy compliance implementation, testing, and legal review.
