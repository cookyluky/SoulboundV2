## Implementation Notes
*This section will be updated with detailed implementation notes as work progresses*

### Key Implementation Considerations
- **Privacy First**: All analytics must be anonymous and respect user privacy
- **Legal Compliance**: GDPR and CCPA compliance is mandatory, not optional
- **Performance Impact**: Analytics tracking must not affect game performance
- **Cross-Platform**: Analytics must work consistently across all target platforms

### Analytics Architecture Planning
- **AnalyticsManager**: Centralized analytics event tracking and management
- **PrivacyManager**: User consent handling and privacy rights management
- **Data Anonymization**: All collected data must be anonymous and aggregated
- **Event System**: Lightweight event tracking integrated throughout gameplay systems

### Privacy Compliance Strategy
- **Consent Management**: Clear, informed consent before any data collection
- **Opt-Out Mechanisms**: Easy and immediate opt-out options for users
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for game improvement
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about what data is collected and why

## Challenges Encountered
*This section will document any challenges, blockers, or issues encountered during implementation*

### Anticipated Challenges
- **Regulatory Complexity**: Privacy laws vary by region and change frequently
- **Technical Integration**: Firebase integration across multiple platforms
- **Performance Balance**: Analytics tracking without affecting gameplay
- **User Experience**: Privacy controls that don't disrupt gameplay flow

## Solutions and Workarounds
*This section will document solutions to problems and any workarounds implemented*

## Code Changes Summary
*This section will track major code changes, file additions, and system modifications*

### Planned File Structure
- `Scripts/Analytics/AnalyticsManager.cs` - Core analytics management system
- `Scripts/Analytics/PrivacyManager.cs` - Privacy consent and user rights management
- `Scripts/Analytics/EventTracker.cs` - Individual event tracking and batching
- `Scripts/Analytics/DataAnonymizer.cs` - Data anonymization and sanitization
- `Scripts/UI/PrivacyConsentUI.cs` - Privacy consent interface and controls
- `Scripts/Analytics/ComplianceValidator.cs` - Privacy regulation compliance validation

## Testing Results
*This section will document testing outcomes and validation results*

### Planned Testing Approach
- **Privacy Compliance Testing**: Verify GDPR and CCPA compliance
- **Data Anonymization Testing**: Confirm no personal data is collected
- **Opt-Out Testing**: Verify opt-out disables all tracking completely
- **Platform Integration Testing**: Test analytics across all target platforms
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure no performance impact from analytics
- **Legal Review**: Professional privacy law compliance verification

## Performance Impact
*This section will track any performance implications of the implementation*

### Performance Targets
- **Event Tracking**: < 0.5ms per analytics event
- **Data Batching**: Batch uploads every 5 minutes or 100 events
- **Memory Usage**: Analytics data should not exceed 10MB in memory
- **Network Impact**: Analytics uploads should not affect gameplay networking
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal battery drain from analytics on mobile platforms

## Dependencies and Integration
*This section will document how this task integrates with other systems and tasks*

### Required Integrations
- **Task 1**: Unity project setup and Firebase SDK integration
- **Task 11**: UI system for privacy consent interfaces
- **Task 12**: Save system for privacy preferences persistence
- **All Game Systems**: Event triggers for analytics data collection

### Integration Points
- **Firebase Analytics**: Core data collection and analysis platform
- **UI System**: Privacy consent dialogs and analytics settings
- **Save System**: User consent preferences and analytics configuration
- **Game Systems**: Event sources throughout all gameplay features
- **Platform Services**: Platform-specific analytics and compliance features

## Privacy Implementation Plan

### GDPR Compliance Implementation
1. **Lawful Basis Documentation**: Document legitimate interest for game improvement
2. **Data Processing Records**: Maintain records of all data processing activities
3. **User Rights Implementation**: Right to access, rectify, erase, and port data
4. **Consent Management**: Clear, specific, and informed consent mechanisms
5. **Data Protection by Design**: Privacy considerations in all system designs

### CCPA Compliance Implementation
1. **Privacy Notice**: Clear disclosure of data collection practices
2. **Consumer Rights**: Implementation of know, delete, and opt-out rights
3. **Non-Discrimination**: No penalties for exercising privacy rights
4. **Authorized Agent Support**: Support for authorized agents acting on behalf of consumers
