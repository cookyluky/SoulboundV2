# Task 1 Overview: Setup Unity Project with Required SDKs

## Task Description
Initialize the Unity 2023.2 LTS project with Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and integrate all required platform-specific SDKs.

## Priority Level
**High** - This is a foundational task that all other tasks depend on.

## Dependencies
None - This is the first task in the project.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Objectives
1. **Unity Environment Setup**
   - Create new Unity 2023.2 LTS project
   - Configure Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for optimized performance
   - Setup initial folder structure following Unity best practices

2. **Platform SDK Integration**
   - Steamworks SDK for PC distribution
   - PlayStation 5 SDK for console development
   - Xbox Game Development Kit for Xbox Series X/S
   - Nintendo Switch SDK for portable platform
   - Android SDK and NDK for mobile deployment
   - iOS development tools (Xcode integration)

3. **Version Control & CI/CD**
   - Setup Perforce version control integration
   - Configure project settings for cross-platform development
   - Implement basic CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Configure build settings for all target platforms
   - Setup development and production build configurations
   - Ensure memory allocation requirements (4GB RAM maximum on console platforms)

## Technical Requirements

### Unity Configuration
- **Engine Version**: Unity 2023.2 LTS
- **Render Pipeline**: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- **Target Platforms**: PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS
- **Memory Constraints**: Maximum 4GB RAM allocation for console platforms

### SDK Requirements
- **Steamworks SDK**: Latest stable version
- **PlayStation 5 SDK**: Official Sony development kit
- **Xbox GDK**: Microsoft Game Development Kit
- **Nintendo Switch SDK**: Official Nintendo development tools
- **Android SDK/NDK**: API level 21+ (Android 5.0+)
- **iOS SDK**: iOS 12.0+ support via Xcode

## Testing Strategy
1. **Project Creation Validation**
   - Verify successful Unity 2023.2 LTS project creation
   - Confirm URP configuration is properly applied
   - Test project loads without errors or warnings

2. **SDK Integration Testing**
   - Validate each platform SDK is properly integrated
   - Confirm no compilation errors exist
   - Test basic SDK functionality (authentication, basic API calls)

3. **Version Control Testing**
   - Verify Perforce connectivity and configuration
   - Test asset check-in/check-out operations
   - Confirm team collaboration workflows function properly

4. **Build Pipeline Validation**
   - Test build generation for all target platforms
   - Verify empty builds complete successfully
   - Confirm memory allocation constraints are respected
   - Validate build sizes are within acceptable ranges

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Unity 2023.2 LTS project created with URP enabled
- [ ] All platform SDKs integrated without errors
- [ ] Perforce version control fully operational
- [ ] Build pipeline generates successful builds for all platforms
- [ ] Memory allocation stays within 4GB limit on console platforms
- [ ] Project structure follows Unity best practices
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline basic implementation complete

## Risk Factors
- **Platform SDK Availability**: Some console SDKs require special licensing
- **Version Compatibility**: SDK versions may conflict with Unity 2023.2 LTS
- **Build Size Constraints**: Platform-specific size limitations may require optimization
- **Memory Limitations**: Console memory constraints may impact asset quality

## Related Documentation
- Unity 2023.2 LTS Documentation
- Platform-specific SDK documentation (Steamworks, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch)
- Universal Render Pipeline documentation
- Perforce Unity integration guide

## Estimated Completion Time
**2-3 weeks** - Includes SDK procurement, setup, integration, and testing across all platforms.
