## Implementation Notes

### Performance Optimization Strategy
The optimization approach will be multi-layered and data-driven:
- **Profiling First**: Identify actual bottlenecks rather than assumed issues
- **Platform-Specific**: Tailor optimizations to each platform's strengths and limitations
- **Iterative Process**: Continuous testing and refinement throughout development
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintain visual fidelity while achieving performance targets

### Technical Approach
1. **Rendering Pipeline Optimization**
   - Implement aggressive LOD systems for complex assets
   - Utilize Unity's Scriptable Render Pipeline (URP) efficiently
   - Optimize shader performance with platform-specific variants
   - Implement dynamic batching and GPU instancing

2. **Memory Management**
   - Asset streaming system for seamless world loading
   - Object pooling for frequently instantiated objects
   - Texture streaming and compression optimization
   - Garbage collection optimization to minimize frame hitches

3. **Platform-Specific Features**
   - Nintendo Switch: Adaptive quality settings for docked/portable modes
   - PlayStation 5: SSD streaming and hardware decompression
   - Xbox Series X/S: Smart Delivery and Variable Rate Shading
   - PC: DLSS/FSR integration and scalable quality settings

2. **Memory**: Asset streaming and texture compression
3. **CPU**: AI processing, physics calculations, script execution
4. **I/O**: Asset loading and save/load operations

## Dependencies and Integration

### Integration Points
- **Rendering System**: All visual systems must be optimized cohesively
- **Asset Management**: Streaming system affects all game content
- **Physics System**: Performance optimizations must maintain gameplay feel
- **Audio System**: Sound processing must not impact frame rate
- **UI System**: Interface must remain responsive during optimization

### External Dependencies
- Unity Profiler and platform-specific profiling tools
- Platform development kits for accurate testing
- Asset optimization tools and texture compression utilities
- Performance monitoring and telemetry systems

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Performance Analysis Setup**
   - Set up Unity Profiler for all target platforms
   - Install platform-specific development and profiling tools
   - Create standardized performance testing scenarios
   - Establish baseline measurements across all platforms

2. **Profiling Infrastructure**
   - Create automated performance testing framework
   - Set up telemetry collection for build-to-build comparison
   - Implement runtime performance monitoring system
   - Create performance regression detection tools

3. **Optimization Planning**
   - Identify primary performance bottlenecks through profiling
   - Prioritize optimization tasks by impact vs. effort
   - Plan platform-specific optimization strategies
   - Create performance budgets for different systems

### Technical Questions to Resolve
- What are the actual performance bottlenecks across different platforms?
- How aggressive can LOD systems be without noticeable quality loss?
- What's the optimal balance between visual quality and performance on Switch?
- How can we leverage platform-specific features for maximum performance gains?

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **Nintendo Switch**: How to handle thermal throttling and performance degradation over time?
- **PlayStation 5**: How to best utilize the custom SSD and decompression block?
- **Xbox Series X/S**: How to optimize for the performance difference between Series X and Series S?
- **PC**: What's the minimum acceptable performance on low-end hardware?

### Optimization Methodology
1. **Measure First**: Establish accurate baselines before making changes
2. **Single Variable**: Test one optimization at a time to measure impact
3. **Platform Testing**: Validate optimizations on actual hardware, not just development machines
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure optimizations don't break existing functionality
5. **Performance Budgets**: Maintain strict performance budgets for each system
