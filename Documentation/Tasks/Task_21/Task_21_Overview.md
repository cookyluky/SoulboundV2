# Task 21 Overview: Layers, Tags & Physics Settings

## Task Description
Configure Unity's Layer system, Tags, and Physics settings to establish proper collision detection, rendering layers, and physics interactions. This foundational setup ensures optimal performance and correct game object interactions throughout the project.

## Priority Level
**High** - Proper layer and physics configuration is essential for collision detection, rendering optimization, and physics simulation accuracy. Must be established early to avoid refactoring across multiple systems.

## Dependencies
- Task 17: Core Manager Singletons

## Detailed Breakdown
This task establishes the fundamental Unity project settings that govern how game objects interact with each other and the physics system. Proper configuration prevents performance issues and ensures predictable behavior across all game systems.

### Layer Configuration Categories
1. **Rendering Layers**
   - Background elements and environmental geometry
   - Gameplay objects (player, enemies, interactive elements)
   - UI and overlay elements
   - Post-processing and effects layers

2. **Physics Collision Layers**
   - Player collision boundaries
   - Enemy collision detection
   - Environment and static geometry
   - Trigger zones and interactive areas
   - Projectiles and spell effects

3. **Culling and Optimization Layers**
   - Camera culling masks for performance
   - LOD system integration
   - Shadow casting and receiving configuration
   - Lighting layer assignments

### Tag System Organization
- **Functional Tags**: Player, Enemy, Environment, Interactive
- **System Tags**: Respawn, MainCamera, GameController
- **State Tags**: Destructible, Collectible, SavePoint
- **Debug Tags**: Debug, Testing, Development

## Technical Requirements

### Layer Matrix Configuration
- Define comprehensive physics collision matrix
- Establish layer-based culling for cameras
- Configure lighting and shadow interactions per layer
- Set up audio listener layer prioritization

### Physics Settings Optimization
- Configure Time settings for consistent frame rates
- Set appropriate gravity and physics iteration counts

- Configure physics debugging and visualization tools

### Integration Standards
- Document layer usage guidelines for team development
- Create naming conventions for layers and tags
- Establish layer allocation for future systems
- Build validation tools for proper layer usage

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All necessary gameplay layers defined and configured
- [ ] Physics collision matrix properly set up
- [ ] Tag system organized with clear naming conventions
- [ ] Camera culling masks configured for optimization
- [ ] Physics settings optimized for target platforms
- [ ] Shadow and lighting layers properly assigned

## Risk Factors

### Configuration Risks
- **Incorrect collision matrix** causing gameplay bugs or performance issues
- **Layer overflow** from poor planning leading to Unity's 32-layer limit
- **Inconsistent usage** across team members causing integration conflicts

### Performance Risks
- **Excessive physics calculations** from poor layer separation
- **Rendering bottlenecks** from inappropriate culling mask setup
- **Memory usage** from unnecessary collision checks and physics iterations

### Maintenance Risks
- **Hard-coded layer references** making future changes difficult
- **Undocumented layer purposes** causing confusion during development
- **Platform-specific issues** from physics settings not optimized for target devices
