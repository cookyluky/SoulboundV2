# Task 16 Overview: Bootstrap Scene & Service Locator

## Task Description
Never-unload scene that wires up every core manager via a central service container. This foundational task establishes the core initialization flow and dependency injection pattern for the entire game.

## Priority Level
**High** - Critical foundation that all other systems depend on. Must be completed before any other core systems can be implemented.

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Setup Unity Project with Required SDKs

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Objectives
1. **Bootstrap Scene Creation**
   - Create persistent initialization scene that never unloads
   - Establish proper scene loading order and management
   - Configure scene to be first in build settings

2. **Service Locator Pattern Implementation**
   - Centralized dependency registration and resolution system
   - Type-safe service access throughout the application
   - Proper lifecycle management for all core services

3. **Core System Initialization**
   - Orchestrated startup sequence for all managers
   - Dependency injection and service registration
   - Graceful error handling during initialization

## Technical Requirements

### Core Classes
```csharp
public class Bootstrapper : MonoBehaviour {
    [SerializeField] private GameObject[] managerPrefabs;
    
    private void Awake() {
        DontDestroyOnLoad(this.gameObject);
        InitializeServices();
        LoadMainMenu();
    }
    
    private void InitializeServices();
    private void LoadMainMenu();
}

public static class ServiceLocator {
    private static Dictionary<Type, object> services = new Dictionary<Type, object>();
    
    public static void Register<T>(T instance);
    public static T Get<T>();
    public static void Unregister<T>();
    public static bool IsRegistered<T>();
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Scene Management**: Bootstrap → MainMenu → Game Scenes
- **All Core Managers**: Registration and initialization through ServiceLocator
- **Build Settings**: Scene 0 configuration and load order
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing services

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Bootstrap.unity scene created and added as Scene 0 in Build Settings
- [ ] Bootstrapper.cs properly initializes all core services
- [ ] ServiceLocator.cs provides type-safe service registration and retrieval
- [ ] Bootstrap scene persists across all scene transitions
- [ ] All manager dependencies resolved correctly on startup
- [ ] Graceful error handling for missing or failed services
- [ ] MainMenu loads automatically after bootstrap completion
- [ ] Performance impact minimal (< 100ms initialization time)
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for service container
- [ ] Works correctly across all target platforms

## Risk Factors
- **Dependency Ordering**: Services may depend on each other requiring careful initialization order
- **Memory Management**: DontDestroyOnLoad objects persist throughout application lifetime
- **Scene Loading**: Improper scene transitions could break the bootstrap flow
- **Service Conflicts**: Multiple instances of the same service type could cause issues
- **Platform Differences**: Initialization may behave differently across platforms

## Related Systems
- **All Core Managers**: GameManager, InputManager, SaveManager, UIManager, AudioManager, SceneLoader
- **Scene Management**: Controls loading and transitions between all scenes
- **Build Settings**: Scene order and platform-specific configurations
- **Unity Application Lifecycle**: Integration with Unity's startup and shutdown processes

## Implementation Architecture

### Bootstrap Scene Structure
```
Bootstrap.unity
├── Bootstrapper (GameObject)
│   ├── Bootstrapper (MonoBehaviour)
│   └── Manager Prefab References
├── Main Camera (for initial setup)
└── EventSystem (for UI initialization)
```

### Service Locator Pattern
- **Registration Phase**: Services register themselves during Awake/Start
- **Resolution Phase**: Services can safely request dependencies after initialization
- **Validation Phase**: Verify all critical services are available before proceeding
- **Cleanup Phase**: Proper unregistration during application shutdown

### Initialization Sequence
1. **Bootstrap Scene Loads** (Unity startup)
2. **Bootstrapper.Awake()** (DontDestroyOnLoad setup)
3. **Service Registration** (Core managers register with ServiceLocator)
4. **Dependency Resolution** (Managers resolve their dependencies)
5. **Validation Check** (Verify all critical services available)
6. **MainMenu Load** (Transition to main menu scene)

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Missing Services**: Log warnings and provide mock implementations where possible
- **Circular Dependencies**: Detection and reporting of circular service dependencies
- **Initialization Failures**: Graceful degradation with fallback behaviors
- **Platform Issues**: Platform-specific initialization paths and error recovery

## Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Services only instantiated when first requested
- **Startup Time**: Minimize initialization time to reduce apparent loading
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient service container with minimal overhead
- **Object Pooling**: Consider pooling for frequently created/destroyed services

## Estimated Completion Time
**3-5 days** - Includes ServiceLocator implementation, Bootstrap scene setup, core manager integration, testing across platforms, and documentation.
